- 👋 Hi, I’m @chris-ebert
- 👀 I’m interested in software quality: systems that work well at scale and are easy to work on. Code that is transparent and plastic enables making products that respond to customer needs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reacitve programming (and, more significanly, debugging reactive programs). Fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: really, I'm busy with work right now. I like to meet folks and have ideas about projects - just no time to make them happen at present.
- 📫 How to reach me: sadly, there's too much spam everywhere. Maybe try submitting a pull request to this repo - that'll be unusual and will catch my eye.
