- 👋 Hi, I’m @chris-ebert
- 👀 I’m interested in software quality: systems that work well at scale and are easy to work on. Code that is transparent and plastic enables making products that respond to customer needs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reacitve programming (and, more significanly, debugging reactive programs). Fun!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: really, I'm busy with work right now. I like to meet folks and have ideas about projects - just no time to make them happen at present.
- 📫 How to reach me: sadly, there's too much spam everywhere. Maybe try submitting a pull request to this repo - that'll be unusual and will catch my eye.

Hey Chris, this is Ismail from Thundra. I'm opening a PR to your repo to catch your eye as you mentioned :)
We've built a CI observability product which I think you, based on your profile, might be interested in looking at. No marketing words, you can check it out yourself and let me know if it makes sense to chat about it. Here's the website link: https://www.runforesight.com/
Best regards, Ismail.
